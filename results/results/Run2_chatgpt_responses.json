    "response_text": "Syracuse’s biggest concern is inconsistency. Despite a nearly even goal differential (+1), the team swings between dominant wins and heavy losses, including a 2–17 defeat and a 16–8 loss, showing vulnerability against top opponents. Their 9 losses include multiple close games (1–2 goal margins), suggesting struggles in late-game execution and closing out tight contests. Defensively, allowing 216 goals in 19 games indicates that opponents score almost as much as Syracuse does. Offensively, the team relies heavily on its top three players—only one player exceeds 46 assists, and only three surpass 30 goals—signaling limited scoring depth."
